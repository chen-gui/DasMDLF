# DAS_denoising_using_MDLF
We propose a deep learning method, which only requires the synthetic data and a few real noise to train the designed network, can denoise DAS data sets from the FORGE and SAFOD projects.
This work can uncover very weak signals from the highly strong noise, and thus enhance earthquake detection using the STA/LTA method.

This work has been submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR): Solid Earth.

We are in the process of organizing the data sets and trained models and are ready to upload them to Github. Then, the results in the paper can be easily reproduced.
